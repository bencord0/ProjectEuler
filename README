Here are my own implementations of the problems listed on projecteuler.net
The sub-problems are written to output the answer to each problem on standard out, or
return non-zero if error or incomplete.
The brief of each problem is included in the source code and can usually be retrieved
with the 'head' command.

Compile using
	qmake -project CONFIG=console TARGET=Euler# to regen the .pro file
	qmake # optional if you want to regen the makefile, you may need to choose -spec
	make

Programs written in C are designed to be ANSI C compliant, running make should work on all
architectures (this may change if I feel like it).
Java programs which are already compiled to object code should work on any machine
with a sane javaVM. Recompilation is usually not necessary.

Notes:
	- To implement more problems, write the corresponding .c and .h file and
	ammend main.c and euler.h, then re-run make.

	- If compiling manually, some programs may need to be linked against functions.h/.c/.o
	- Other libraries include the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library to deal with the
	limitations that normal C has when dealing with BigNums.

	- The only dependancy for the C programs is the ANSI standard and libgmp.
	- Build dependancies are qmake from the Qt project.
